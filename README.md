# 57.000+ free Books deserve a beautiful home! 
Thats why we went ahead and thought of ways to improve the user experience (UX) of gutenberg.org 
the largest open source project for making books a public good.
In order to let everybody take part in this process we made it available here and everybody who wants to help 
is welcome!

### New Features!
* Modern design
* Easier book search
* Brand new mobile app!

### New Logo

We simplified the logo using only the G in the font "gutenberg" and made it black giving it a 
premium, classic look.

### New Homepage

We gave gutenberg.org a much improved, modern design. 
Nothing should distract from the core, element of the site - the books. 
Thats why we also added a new kind of search: If you open a website
for reading books, you want to tell it what you want to read and it better be as quick as possible ;). 
So we placed the search as a prominent element on the main page,
capturing the users attention immediatly.
Based on the entries the user did on the search field
the site dispays the user then book recommendations. 

### One place for both books and audiobooks.

Having one website that does it all is radically improving the ease of use.
So we want to combine project gutenberg and libriVox.
If a book is available as audiobook as well, it is indiacted by a headphones icon on the cover.

### Making contributions easier

The gutenberg projects depends on contributions, thats why contributing should be made as easy as possible.
So we added the possibility to set up a profile, benefitting also the user experience of the site,
as the profile can be used to set up personal booklists and reading preferences.
When content is missing (Be it a translation, an audio recording or reviews) the possibility to add new 
content is displayed prominently.

### New Design for Blocked Page / 404 Page

![alt text](http://www.gutenberg.org/pics/pg-logo-002.png "Old logo") 

We are based in Germany where project gutenberg is currently faced with a lawsuit over a few books, which
led to the blockage of german IP Adresses. The current page german users are "greeted" with is definitely
worth improving. So we created a new design for 404, Blocked or error pages on gutenberg.org 

# Contribute

So far these ideas are all just concepts and mockups. We havent even started with updating 
the design of the other subpages on gutenberg.org. So theres a lot left to do.  
But if you are a designer/programmer dont hestitate to jump aboard and get involved :)

Together we make project gutenberg a more beautiful place!


# To Do

* Design mobile page / maybe even app
* create designs for all other subpages on gutenberg.org
* code designs in css, html, js
* submit them to the gutenberg team

# P.S.
 
 If anyone knows a way to get in touch with the gutenberg team 
 we'd love to hear that, as were currently trying to contact them ;)
 Thanks in advance!
